# E02a-Operators
An exercise exploring python operators and data types


The main.py file is broken into many functions (def blocks), each of which is designed to perform a basic operation. Many of these are arithmetic, some work with lists or strings, and others produce random values.

This is a useful reference for a lot of basic functions that will be needed frequently. You could also make these functions public, so that if you wished to use them on an unrelated project you could, rather than typing out the code to achieve each of these goals individually.
